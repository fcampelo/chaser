- Test run_chase()
- Finish debugging version 0, particularly: stat = "median" and method = "boot")
- Document the ridiculous amount of time taken by the bootstrap. Maybe add an input parameter for growing the sample more quickly, which will need fewer bootstraps (= faster).
- Paralelize evaluations
